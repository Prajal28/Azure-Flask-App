# Flask and PostgreSQL for Azure App Service

Python flask app hosted on Microsoft Azure with PostgreSQL models ready to connect. Includes data visualization methods using Chart.js to improve the understanding of data represented to the user and infer accordingly. 

The database connection information is specified via environment variables `DBHOST`, `DBPASS`, `DBUSER`, and `DBNAME`. This app always uses the default PostgreSQL port.
